Assuming you are running on a Raspberry Pi 2-4 or Zero (tested with bookworm):

1. Install all necessary packages to synthesize top.v and build bit image (top.bin) for the ice4pi:

 sudo apt-get install yosys fpga-icestorm arachne-pnr flashrom
 make

2. Make sure your Pi has I2C enabled (e.g. use raspi-config)

3. Load the top.bin file to the shield:

 sudo make load

---

Connect data input pin to PIN11 of the Raspberry Pi 2x20 connector (mapped to sig1 signal in top.pcf) 

All your first 8 LEDs should be on at 100% capacity and a reset and reload should be done every second.
